// This file serves as a central contract file for API interfaces.
// Individual interfaces are now located in separate files:
//
// - ApiVersionInterface.php - API versioning contract
// - TransformerInterface.php - Data transformation contract
// - ResourceInterface.php - API resource contract
// - PaginatorInterface.php - Pagination contract
//
// Import these interfaces directly from their respective files.

/**
 * Main API contracts have been separated into individual files
