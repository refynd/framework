# Contributing to Refynd Framework

Thank you for considering contributing to Refynd Framework! We welcome contributions from developers of all skill levels.

## üéØ How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check the issue list as you might find that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title**
- **Describe the exact steps to reproduce the problem**
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**
- **Describe the behavior you observed and what behavior you expected**
- **Include details about your configuration and environment**

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are welcome! Please provide the following information:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title**
- **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement**
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**
- **Describe the current behavior and explain the behavior you expected**
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful**

### Pull Requests

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`
2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards
3. **Add tests** for any new functionality
4. **Ensure all tests pass**
5. **Update documentation** as needed
6. **Submit a pull request**

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- PHP 8.2 or higher
- Composer
- Git

### Setup

```bash
# Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/framework.git
cd framework

# Install dependencies
composer install

# Run tests to ensure everything works
composer test
```

## üß™ Testing

We use PHPUnit for testing. All new features should include tests.

```bash
# Run all tests
composer test

# Run tests with coverage
composer test:coverage

# Run static analysis
composer analyse

# Run all checks
composer check
```

### Writing Tests

- Place tests in the `tests/` directory
- Follow the existing test structure and naming conventions
- Write both unit and integration tests where appropriate
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request

## üìù Coding Standards

### PHP Standards

- Follow PSR-12 coding style
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Add proper PHPDoc comments for classes and methods
- Keep methods focused and single-purpose

### Code Organization

- Place new classes in appropriate namespaces
- Follow the existing directory structure
- Keep files focused on a single responsibility

### Example

```php
<?php

namespace Refynd\Example;

/**
 * Example class demonstrating coding standards
 */
class ExampleClass
{
    private string $property;

    /**
     * Constructor
     *
     * @param string $property The property value
     */
    public function __construct(string $property)
    {
        $this->property = $property;
    }

    /**
     * Get the property value
     *
     * @return string
     */
    public function getProperty(): string
    {
        return $this->property;
    }
}
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Guidelines

### Principles

- **Single Responsibility**: Each class should have one reason to change
- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions
- **Interface Segregation**: Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface

### Framework Components

When adding new components:

1. **Create interfaces** for new functionality
2. **Implement concrete classes** that fulfill the interfaces
3. **Add service providers** or modules for dependency injection
4. **Write comprehensive tests**
5. **Update documentation**

## üìö Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Use PHPDoc comments for all public methods and properties
- Include parameter types, return types, and descriptions
- Document any exceptions that might be thrown

### User Documentation

- Update relevant documentation files when adding features
- Include code examples in documentation
- Keep examples simple and focused
